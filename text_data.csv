Dear Principal,1
I can only think of one reason that it would be good to do that.,0
Also if i may suggest it wouldn't make kids happy they wouldn't get as much exercise.,1
Sincerely.,1
I strongly believe that you should not put the policy of students needing to have at least a B average in order to play sports.,1
First of all students that don't have good grades need to be able to play sports in order to keep them in school,1
Playing sports in school entices kids to go to school for the chance to play on the team.,1

Recently the issue of whether education is a life-long process has been in the limelight.,1
This issue has aroused wide concern in the public.,1
In this article I would like to discuss this issue in detail.,1
Education is not a one-time event.,1
It is an ongoing process.,1
The process of education begins with the child's birth and continues throughout his or her life.,1
This process is called 'education' because it is the process by which a child learns to read write speak  and understand the world.,1
A child who has not been educated will not be able to do any of these things.,1
Therefore  education should be regarded as a lifelong process.,1
Education is not just an event that happens at the end of a person's life.,1
Education should not stop when a person reaches the age of majority.,1
However some people do not agree with this view.,1
They believe that the education of children is only a short period of time.,1
They think education should not continue beyond that period.,1
Some of them even go so far as to say that children should never be educated at all.,1
These people are known as anti-educationists.,1
Their views are not shared by the majority of people in this country.,1
So let us look at this question from a different angle.,1
What is education?,1
What does it mean to be 'educated'?,1
What are the benefits of being educated?,1
Let us examine these questions and see if we can answer the question 'Is education a good thing or a bad thing?',1
Is education a good thing?,1
The benefits of being educated are numerous.,1
The first thing we need to consider is whether there is any benefit to having an educated person in our society.,1
There are many benefits that can be derived from having a well-educated person.,1
A person who is well-educated has a better chance of finding a job.,1
They are more likely to get a higher salary.,1
They are also more likely to be promoted in their job and gain respect from others.,1
An educated person is also more likely to get married and have a family.,1
An educated man or woman can be more successful in their career.,1
They can earn more money than someone who does not have an education even if the latter has more education.,1
Dear Senator,1
Dear,1
I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College.,1
I believe we should elect our President by popular vote.,1
The Electoral College is a system that was created over 200 years ago.,1
At that time the United States was a very different country.,1
It made sense to have a system that gave more power to smaller states.,1
However the United States has changed a lot since then.,1
The Electoral College is no longer a fair or representative system.,1
In recent years there have been elections where the popular vote winner lost the election.,1
This happened in 2000 when George W.Bush won despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore.,1
It also happened in 2016 when Donald Trump won despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.,1
These elections show that the Electoral College is not a fair system.,1
A candidate can win the presidency by securing a few key states.,1
This can happen even if they lose the popular vote by millions.,1
This is not a democratic system.,1
It is unfair to the majority of voters.,1
There are several reasons to abolish the Electoral College.,1
First  electing the President by popular vote would be more democratic.,1
The candidate with the most votes would win.,1
Everyone's vote would count equally.,1
Second it would make our elections fairer.,1
A candidate could not win the presidency without winning the popular vote.,1
Third it would make elections more competitive.,1
Candidates would need to appeal to voters in all parts of the country.,1
They could not focus only on a few key states.,1
I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College.,1
We need to elect our President by popular vote.,1
It is time for a fair and democratic system of government.,1
One day last year my husband called me from his office. ,0
Mike was right. ,0
My husband Mike was so impressed with CASHFLOW. ,0
It was the educational product I had been looking for. ,0
I was not able to stay and talk with Robert after we had played the game but we agreed to meet later to further discuss his project. ,0
We found out we had a lot in common. ,0
Robert primary concern was the growing gap between the haves and have nots in America and around the world. ,0
My dad? asked Mike with a scrunched up face. ,0
Learn anything yet? rich dad asked.,0
“How it going boys?” ,0
Once people have studied and become financially literate. ,0
they may still face roadblocks to becoming financially independent. ,0
The fear of losing money is real. ,0
The UNs World Food Programme is giving food and cash to people. ,0
But it needs much more money. ,0
The UN says that 27 million people are hungry. ,0
21 million children are not getting enough food. ,0
The drought will continue until March or April 2025. ,0
People will have new crops then. ,0
El Niño makes some places too dry. ,0
It is not possible to stop it. ,0
The UN needs 369 million dollars to help people in South Africa. ,0
Five countries Lesotho Malawi Namibia Zambia and Zimbabwe are in trouble. ,0
No rain means that crops and animals are dying. ,0
Angola and Mozambique also have problems. ,0
Many people in the Americas saw an annular solar eclipse. ,0
This event happens rarely when the moon moves in front of the sun and it creates a ring of fire in the sky. ,0
Musk says that these selfdriving cars will be much safer than human drivers. ,0
But there are still problems with safety. ,0
The Cybercab will cost 20 cents per mile to use and the robovan will cost only 5 cents per mile. ,0
Musk also talks about Tesla's robot called Optimus. ,0
Some people are unhappy because Musk does not give much information about the robotaxi. ,0

During World War II two. ,0
nutritionists Elsie Widdowson and Robert McCance tested a diet based. ,0
on what the UK could produce if German Uboats cut off food imports. ,0
The diet was very restrictive one egg per week. ,0
limited sugar and small amounts of meat fish and dairy. ,0
To test if it was enough to stay healthy. ,0
they followed this diet while doing intense physical activity in the Lake District. ,0
Despite the low food intake their findings. ,0
showed people could maintain health and fitness under such conditions though they noted an increase in flatulence. ,0
Dear Senator Many people might agree theat we shouldnt have an Electoral College at all. ,0
since most of the time it doesnt seem to work at all since of instead just voting on the person or candidate you would prefer. ,0
It can be proven in two simple reasons on why the Electoral College still works certainty of outcome and the simple fact theat its everyones president. ,0
This is not the case however and in fact the Electoral College does seem to function. ,0
it would work as well as we do right now withe thee Electoral College. ,0
since there will be more disputes on popular vote than on the Electoral College. ,0
Its true after all that thee Electoral Colleges votes exceed over the popular votes. ,0
He states The reason is that the winning candidates. ,0
share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. ,0
It could be also said that even if the government actually switches to popular vote. ,0
we know it would work since it doesnt exceed how on Electoral College votes go. ,0
which can be also seen as a simpler process of voting. ,0
On another note in some cases theere can be ties between two candidates. ,0
as seen in 1992s Election between Nixon and Clinton on the popular vote. ,0
To summarize the certainty of outcome is far greater. ,0
in the Electoral College rather than the popular vote due to sheer number of votes in the Electoral College. ,0
On a second note thee fact theat thee american people can vote enough theat. ,0
it's everyones president is anotheer reason on why the Electoral college does work.,0
The Electoral College works by havng thee winner win transregionally ratheer thean just focus on just on region theat just favors theem and only theem. ,0
So instead of one region getting thee candidate theat prefers and focuses on only them. ,0
everyone can have a candidate theat will focus largely on the nation&#39;s issues ratheer thean just a specific part ot thee country. ,0
For example lets say theat thee largest population of people in a regon in the United States is thee southe not saying it is or isnt its just an example. ,0
The southe is mainly republican so theey will only vote for a republican theat will focus majorly on thee southe. ,0
It is unfair for the rest of thee regions. ,0
such as thee Northeeast  Middle Pacific and otheer regions of the United States since they are mainly democratic not really it is used as an example who would want focus on their region as well too. ,0
In Bradford plumber&#39;s article on why the Electoral College should be gone. ,0
he states that thee electoral college is unfair to voters since most candidates did not bother withe thee states they know they have no chance of winning at all. ,0
There could be an easy counter argument. ,0
against this since those states have probably already made up their minds on who to vote for. ,0
like a democratic candidate visiting Texas where it&#39;s mainly republican they know who Texas is going to vote for. ,0
there is no use in trying to convince them when they have already made up their minds. ,0
same goes if a republican candidate tries to convince the democratic California. ,0
Also someone can easily counterattack most of the arguments brought up in the plumbers article. ,0
since this was written before the 2004 election. ,0
and it has been a decade already plenty of things couldve changed during the course if ten years in politics. ,0
has been a decade already plenty of things couldve changed during the course if ten years in politics.,0
In order to make a greater argument against the electoral college one must have an updated list of facts. ,0
in order to back it up. ,0
as certain things could've changed during a certain course of a decade. ,0
During the course of a decade. ,0
we seen how affective thee electoral college was during the 2004 elections. ,0
In a final note the electoral college is thee vote on the peoples president is true. ,0
and with holds it since it can focus on rather than on one specific region but the nation as a whole. ,0
In summarization the electoral college should be kept due to the simple reasoning of certainty of outcome and the voting on the peoples president. ,0
After reading the article called Making Mona Lisa Smile. ,0
And about how there is a machine that can actually read peoples emotions and put their emotions into percentages. ,0
And how they used it to find out how the Mona Lisa was feling when she was painted i think that is truly amazing. ,0
i think that we should use this technology at school to read the students emotions. ,0
I think its a great idea to use for school. ,0
so teachers can tell how the student is feeling and can find a way to help them. ,0
In paragraph 6 the author uses the exmple of how we could use this new technology during school for example. ,0
he wrote If you smile when a web ad appears on you screen a similar ad might follow. ,0
But if you frown the next ad might be different. ,0
And instead of ads they could be explanations on how to do a problem.,0
I think that that would improve the students learning. ,0
In conclusion i think that we should use this new techonoly to our aventage and use it in the classrooms. ,0
so we can tell which students need help and which one doesn't. ,0
That way we can help them. They might even learn even more. ,0
Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe have worked on a software that can detect how a person is feeling. ,0
The software is called teh FAcial Action Coding System or FACS. ,0
The software can use muscle detectors to analyze and detect how a person is feeling. ,0
From my perspective I think this is a great software to have especially for certain situations. ,0
Some situations may include popping up media. ,0
One reason why I think this is a great idea is because of its function. ,0
where it recognizes what youre feeling and make modifications based around it. ,0
so you'll feel better. ,0
In the text it mentions of how the software can detect whether someone is confused or bored. ,0
and can make some modifications to better suit the person. ,0
This shows that when it does that it can help students better understand the topic.,0
In the text it mentions how when the software detects your emotion. ,0
it sends over an ad based on how you feel. ,0
This shows that if someone is feeling sad. ,0
they can send them an article about how to get better. ,0
or how to overcome a loss which is really useful.,0
This is great for using media to assist you but of course it has a human caused benefit. ,0
The software can help you make random faces and when done it can help you with your emotions. ,0
In the text it states that making fake smiley faces actually causes you to feel slightly happy. ,0
This shows that when youre making a fake smiley face when down. ,0
theres a chemical in your body that actually can help you get better. ,0
In the text it states that Stanislavsky has his students make happy faces and frowning faces due to the previous fact to help them better act. ,0
This shows that the software can help you detect whether or not youre actually acting a feeling well or not. ,0
Now there is a benefit for those who dont have a software. ,0
The software can detect facial muscles and that helps it point out what a person is feeling. ,0
In the text it states that the software successfully recognized Mona Lisas facial muscles. ,0
And it showed her to be 83% happy. ,0
This shows that the software can go through many paintings and easily detect how theyre feeling. ,0
In the text it states that with its muscle detecting technology. ,0
it can detect whether or now a politician or celebrity is being truthful or not.,0
This shows that the software can detect whether. ,0
or not a celebrity is lying and that can helpful especially in an allegation. ,0
Overall I believe that this technology is good to have around. ,0
It can detect how you feel and attempt to assist you. ,0
It can cause you to make fake happy faces and actually feel happy. ,0
Finally it can help out with detecting a truthful person or not. ,0
With that said I believe that this will go great with classrooms in the country. ,0
This would not be denifical in a classroom because it would make students uncomfortable knowing something is watching them. ,0
this would need its own computer to run. ,0
and it could not handle 30 people at a time. ,0
First people dont like being spyed on. ,0
so having a computer program watching them all day would get some people feeling scared or unconfortable. ,0
Second the actical siad home computers cant handle the complex algorithms. ,0
and school computers are old and not as good as most computers at home so they would need a dedicated computer just for this program. ,0
Finaly the artical said it counted action point based off mussel movement up to 44 for one person. ,0
but for a class of 30 people it would have to find individual people and measure their mussel movement independently from everyone else. ,0
So this program would not be useful because people would get uncomfortable. ,0
cost and proccessing power need to run the program and individual detection is needed before it can be used for a class room. ,0
The opportunity to further an education should always be taken advantage of. ,0 
The use of distance learning can allow a student to learn what may be necessary at a time and place comfortable for them. ,0
Distance learning allows for a better understanding of a lesson or subject and creates a comfortable work environment. ,0
If used positively it can start a major change in students grades and overall performance by giving them a form of learning outside a normal classroom. ,0
